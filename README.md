# Description
IdleCraft is a mobile Android game developed with Android Studio, Kotlin, and Java. Players can gather, craft, upgrade, buy, sell, and store materials. Upgrades can be obtained to increase maximum inventory capacity of specific materials and automate the gathering of materials. The goal of IdleCraft is to be an "idle" game. In other words, automated gathering still takes place even when the player isn't playing the game. Players can then craft new items with their gathered materials. Players also have the option to buy or sell any gathered or crafted item directly from their inventory to obtain currency. Currency can be used to upgrade materials even more.
